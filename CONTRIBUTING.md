## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## I Have a Question

> **Note:** Before you ask a question, please read the [README](README.md) and search for existing [Issues](../../issues) that might help you.

Before asking a question, it's best to search for existing issues or discussions that might help you. In case you found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in that issue.

If you still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open a new [issue](../../issues/new/choose)
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into
- Provide project and platform versions (Home Assistant, browser, etc), depending on what seems relevant

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information, and describe the issue in detail in your report.

Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible:

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side (e.g., using incompatible Home Assistant version)
- Check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](../../labels/bug)
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (if applicable)
  - Home Assistant version
  - Browser and version
  - Device type (mobile, desktop, tablet)
  - Apple Home Dashboard version
  - Dashboard configuration
  - Console errors from browser developer tools
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> **Important:** You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to the project maintainers.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](../../issues/new/choose) and select the "Bug report" template
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked as a bug and left to be implemented by someone

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Apple Home Dashboard, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Read the [README](README.md) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered
- Search the [issues](../../issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project (Apple Home design consistency)

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](../../issues).

- Use the **"Feature request"** template when creating the issue
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Apple Home Dashboard users
- You may want to **include screenshots or mockups** which help you demonstrate the feature or point out the part which the suggestion is related to
